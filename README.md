## <a name="introduction">📎 Introduction</a>

The PokéStudio is not just an ordinary Pokedex app you've seen multiple times.
It goes beyond that, allowing users to browse their favorite Pokémon, access
detailed information, and more. Upon registration, users gain access to their
personal Pokédex, a storage for unique Pokémon cards obtained from packs. These
cards play a crucial role in battling against an AI opponent, earning coins to
purchase additional packs. You can also enjoy the PokeStudio community and share
some posts from pokemon world!
