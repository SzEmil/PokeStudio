# PokeStudio
The PokéStudio is not just an ordinary Pokedex app you've seen multiple times. 
It goes beyond that, allowing users to browse their favorite Pokémon, access detailed information, and more. 
Upon registration, users gain access to their personal Pokédex, a storage for unique Pokémon cards obtained from packs. 
These cards play a crucial role in battling against an AI opponent, earning coins to purchase additional packs. 
Exciting updates are planned, Card shop.
